/**
 * If you annotate a method with the Trace annotation it will be automatically timed by the New Relic agent with the
 * following measurements:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>call count</li>
 * <li>calls per minute</li>
 * <li>total call time</li>
 * <li>standard deviation call time</li>
 * <li>min call time</li>
 * <li>max call time</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * A metric representing these measurements will be reporting inside the call scope of the current transaction (e.g.,
 * "/servlets/myservlet") so that New Relic can "break out" the response time of a given transaction by specific called
 * methods. A rollup summary metric (all invocations of the method for every transaction) will also be reported.
 * 
 * Be mindful when using this annotation. When placed on relatively heavyweight operations such as database access or
 * webservice invocation, its overhead will be negligible. On the other hand, if placed on a tight, frequently called
 * method (e.g., an accessor that is called thousands of times per second), then the tracer will introduce higher
 * overhead to your application.
