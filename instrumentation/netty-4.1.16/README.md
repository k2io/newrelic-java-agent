# Netty

In addition to supporting HTTP/1, this instrumentation module adds support for
HTTP/2 starting with Netty version `io.netty:netty-all:4.1.16.Final`.

At the time this instrumentation was added the most recent version of Netty was
`io.netty:netty-all:4.1.107.Final` and virtually all the HTTP/2 APIs in the
project are annotated as unstable.

## HTTP/2

HTTP/2 works in a fundamentally different manner than HTTP/1.

> At the core of all performance enhancements of HTTP/2 is the new binary framing layer, which dictates how the HTTP messages are encapsulated and transferred
> between the client and server.
>
>The "layer" refers to a design choice to introduce a new optimized encoding mechanism between the socket interface and the higher HTTP API exposed to our
> applications: the HTTP semantics, such as verbs, methods, and headers, are unaffected, but the way they are encoded while in transit is different.
>
>In short, HTTP/2 breaks down the HTTP protocol communication into an exchange of binary-encoded frames, which are then mapped to messages that belong to a
> particular stream, all of which are multiplexed within a single TCP connection.
>
>* Stream: A bidirectional flow of bytes within an established connection, which may carry one or more messages.
>* Message: A complete sequence of frames that map to a logical request or response message.
>* Frame: The smallest unit of communication in HTTP/2, each containing a frame header, which at a minimum identifies the stream to which the frame belongs.
>
>The relation of these terms can be summarized as follows:
>* All communication is performed over a single TCP connection that can carry any number of bidirectional streams.
>* Each stream has a unique identifier and optional priority information that is used to carry bidirectional messages.
>* Each message is a logical HTTP message, such as a request, or response, which consists of one or more frames.
>* The frame is the smallest unit of communication that carries a specific type of dataâ€”e.g., HTTP headers, message payload, and so on. Frames from different
   streams may be interleaved and then reassembled via the embedded stream identifier in the header of each frame.

## HTTP/2 Instrumentation

To instrument HTTP/2, instrumentation points are weaved where the `io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2Headers` are available. The `Http2Headers` are wrapped and used to collect info about the  request and response.

### Request

`io.netty.handler.codec.http2.DefaultHttp2ConnectionDecoder$FrameReadListener` is weaved to start a transaction for HTTP/2 requests and process the requests headers. 

When `FrameReadListener.onHeadersRead` is invoked on the `Http2Headers` request headers, `NettyDispatcher.channelRead` is called which stores
a `token` in the Netty context pipeline, starts a transaction, and sets/wraps the request headers on the transaction.

### Response

`io.netty.handler.codec.http2.Http2FrameWriter` is weaved to process the HTTP/2 response headers.

When `Http2FrameWriter.writeHeaders` is invoked on the `Http2Headers` response headers, `NettyUtil.processResponse` is called which uses the
`token` in the Netty context pipeline to get the transaction, sets/wraps the response on the transaction, and expires the `token`.
